        <p>A simple recipe on how to make fried potatoes</p>
        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 pounds of peeled potatoes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F</li>
            <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Add the salt</li>
